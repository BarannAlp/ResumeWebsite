    const amadeusText='During my time as a Software Developer at Amadeus, I undertook a Spring Boot Project focused on enhancing web service management. My task was to develop a system using Java Spring Boot and REST APIs that could efficiently log both incoming requests and outgoing responses. These interactions were then securely stored in an Oracle database for future reference. The integration of Oracle ensured data integrity and scalability, while Tomcat facilitated smooth deployment. This experience highlights my ability to architect comprehensive solutions by effectively leveraging diverse technologies. Initially I am working as a part-time Software Developer at Amadeus'
